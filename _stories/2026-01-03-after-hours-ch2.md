The Monday morning sun streamed through Jessica's apartment window as she got ready for work. The conversation with Mr. Collins had replayed in her mind all weekend.

She arrived at the office early, before most of her colleagues. The elevator doors opened on the executive floor just as she was stepping in.

"Good morning, Jessica."

He was holding two cups of coffee.

## A New Beginning

"I wasn't sure how you take it," he said, offering her one of the cups. "I guessed black."

"You guessed right." She took the cup, their fingers briefly touching. 

The office was still quiet around them. The morning light painted everything in soft gold.

"About Friday night—" she started.

"We should do it again sometime," he interrupted. "The conversation, I mean. It's been a long time since I've talked to someone who actually listens."

She smiled. "I'd like that."

## Navigating New Territory

The weeks that followed changed everything. Their late-night conversations became a ritual—always professional, yet increasingly personal. She learned about his divorce, his daughter in college, his passion for classical music that he never shared with anyone at work.

He learned about her dreams of starting her own consulting firm, her fears of never being good enough, her love of vintage films.

"You know people will talk," he said one evening, as they sat in the conference room watching the sunset paint the city in shades of orange and pink.

"Let them," she replied. "This isn't about them. This is about us."
