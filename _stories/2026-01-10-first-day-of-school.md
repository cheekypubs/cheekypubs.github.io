The morning sun filtered through the old oak tree outside the window as Emily gathered her things for the first day at her new school. She had been dreading this moment ever since her family moved across the country last month.

## A New Beginning

"Emily, you're going to be late!" her mother called from downstairs.

She took one last look in the mirror, straightening her uniform. The crisp white blouse and plaid skirt felt foreign after years of public school dress codes. This was going to be different. Very different.

The hallways of St. Catherine's Academy were nothing like her old school. The walls were adorned with portraits of stern-looking headmistresses from decades past, each seeming to watch her every move. The click of her Mary Janes echoed off the marble floors as she made her way to her first class.

## Meeting Miss Hartford

"You must be the new student," said a voice that stopped her in her tracks.

Emily turned to find a tall woman with silver-streaked hair and sharp eyes that seemed to see right through her. Her name tag read "Miss Hartford - Dean of Students."

"Yes, ma'am. Emily Parker."

"Welcome to St. Catherine's, Miss Parker. I trust you've read our handbook?"

Emily nodded, though she'd only skimmed it. Something about the way Miss Hartford looked at her suggested that might have been a mistake.

"Very good. Then you'll know we have high expectations here. Very high expectations indeed."
